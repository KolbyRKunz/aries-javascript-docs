# React Native

The setup for React Native is rather different than Node.js. We do not have to install dependencies on the host-platform, but for the build target. This would be the
[indy-sdk](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk) for Android and iOS.

>It is recomended that you use the [`Hermes Javascript engine`](https://hermesengine.dev/). In some cases this is used automatically by React Native but not always.
